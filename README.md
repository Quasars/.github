## Quasar

Welcome to the Quasar development organization!

### What is Quasar?

Quasar is an open source project building on a collection of data analysis toolboxes
extending the [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/) suite. We empower researchers from a variety of fields to gain
better insight to their data through interactive data visualization, powerful machine
learning methods and combining different datasets in easy to understand visual workflows.

### Question?

Come say hello in our [discussions](https://github.com/Quasars/orange-spectroscopy/discussions) area or [contact us](https://quasar.codes/contact/) directly.

### I have some code to contribute, where should it go?

If you have a widget / pre-processor / file-loader that you would like to contribute to the distribution,
take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Quasars/orange-spectroscopy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and submit a pull request to one of the main add-on repositories.

For useful scripts you would like to make public or early widget designs that could use some time to mature,
consider the [orange-spectroscopy-prototypes](https://github.com/Quasars/orange-spectroscopy-prototypes)
and [orange-spectroscopy-pythonscripts](https://github.com/Quasars/orange-spectroscopy-pythonscripts) repositories.
